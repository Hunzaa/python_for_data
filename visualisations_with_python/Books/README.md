# My Virtual Bookstore

---

A fun and simple data project exploring global reading habits using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

---

## What’s Inside?

This notebook takes you on a little tour through book ratings, readers, and trends using a public dataset from Kaggle. You’ll find:

- Most rated books  
- Where readers are from  
- Readers by age and what authors they like  
- A heatmap comparing book ratings across countries  
- A mini book recommender (just for fun!)

---

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy for data handling  
- Seaborn & Matplotlib for visualizations  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- A little interactivity with `input()`  
- IPython display for showing book cover images

--- 

## Dataset

This notebook uses the [Book Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/bookcrossing-dataset) (books, users, and ratings CSV files). Make sure all 3 CSVs are in the same folder as the notebook.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone this repo  
2. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code  
3. Run the cells step by step  
4. For the mini recommender at the end, follow the prompts!

> **Note**: The book cover images work best when run locally. They might not display on GitHub preview.
